# LearningRepo
This is my first repo made just for getting a hang of github
I learned how to initialise git inside a directory or folder, how to add files to staging area then commiting it,
how to commit without adding to staging area, how to create a branch, how to switch between branches,
how to connect your local repo to github, how to push, how to pull
